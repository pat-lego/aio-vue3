Welcome to my Adobe I/O Application!

## Setup

- Populate the `.env` file in the project root and fill it as shown [below](#env)

## Local Dev

- `aio app run` to start your local Dev server
- App will run on `localhost:9080` by default

By default the UI will be served locally but actions will be deployed and served from Adobe I/O Runtime. To start a
local serverless stack and also run your actions locally use the `aio app run --local` option.

## Config

### `.env`

You can generate this file using the command `aio app use`. 

```bash
# This file must **not** be committed to source control

## please provide your Adobe I/O Runtime credentials
# AIO_RUNTIME_AUTH=
# AIO_RUNTIME_NAMESPACE=
```

### `app.config.yaml`

- Main configuration file that defines an application's implementation. 
- More information on this file, application configuration, and extension configuration 
  can be found [here](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/appbuilder-configuration/#appconfigyaml)

#### Action Dependencies

- You have two options to resolve your actions' dependencies:

  1. **Packaged action file**: Add your action's dependencies to the root
   `package.json` and install them using `npm install`. Then set the `function`
   field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **entry file** of your action
   folder.

  2. **Zipped action folder**: In the folder containing the action code add a
     `package.json` with the action's dependencies. Then set the `function`
     field in `app.config.yaml` to point to the **folder** of that action. We will
     install the required dependencies within that directory and zip the folder
     before deploying it as a zipped action. Use this method if you want to keep
     your action's dependencies separated.

# Building
